# UCD Computational Network Analysis COMP47270 - case studies

This module focused on modern computational techniques to extract information from large-scale networks and the case studies explored
algorithms to find dense clusters in networks, community finding in social networks and trust networks and their application in recommender systems.  

The studies were done in Python and presented in Jupyter notebooks. While the recommended way to view these files is by running the notebooks locally,
github ipynb viewer does also a good job with some minor formatting issues.


## Case Study 1

This case study focuses on network analysis and modeling by using graphs taken from the `SNAP` repository.

## Case Study 2

This case study focuses on implementing a community-finding algorithm and comparing it's quality with one from the networkx package.

## Case Study 3

This case study focuses on implementing a rating prediction algorithm that can be used to produce recommendations for a given user.
The study also tries to determine, if incorporating trust values in the algorithm can improve the quality of predictions.
